## [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org): Integration with [Protractor](http://angular.github.io/protractor) + [WebDriver](http://webdriver.io/)

This repo is just a little demo of how to configure *.travis.yml* to perform a "build" process (a test process in our case) and call *Potractor*, *WebDriver* and install the needed dependencies before to start.
